### Hi there :wave:

I am [Andrew R. McCluskey](https://mccluskey.scot), a scientist and programmer.

My research focuses on neutron reflectometry methods, with a particular focus on their analysis and interpretation, working at the European Spallation Source's Data Management and Software Centre.
In addition to research, I teach a final year undergraduate course in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bath, introducing students to Python programming and it's application in the chemical sciences.
